* Telemetry fields (8+ bytes)
    * Timestamp (27 bits)
        * 86,400,000 milliseconds in a day
            * 2^27 = 134,217,728
        * Sends "date update" to synchronize date every X seconds (5?)
    * Command Code (10 bits for 1024 commands/telemetries)
        * Stage 1: 6 bits for 64 topics, 4 bits for 16 commands 
        * Stage 2+: All enumerated in config 
    * Data length (11 for 2048 length)
    * Data (0-2048 bytes)
    * CRC (2 bytes)
* Each telemetry is at minimum 8 bytes
